            <h1>How technology has affected us in our daily lives</h1>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">

                   Technology is very powerful and nothing is as good as technology at improving life. Even though this is both good on paper and on the surface there are drawbacks to this. Technology can affect life both positively and negatively. New technology always changes our life very much and takes it to a new level. It is like the new way of thinking or doing the normal things defferently, better and much more faster with less hassle and at much affordable rate. Imagine life before Electricity, life before Telephone, life before the Automobile, life before the laptops and phones. Before those technologies life was much less complex but it was at the same time very difficult to get many things done with just the twelve hours of visible light that we are given each day. The new technologies are results of our creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving techniques but it is important that technological development should be human and enviromental friendly. Technology is a flower for life, not a productivity killer. Technology is everywhere and in everything that is involved in our daily life. New Technology improves quality of life for human beings and as a side effect makes it complex and have a negative effects on the environment.

                   The electricity  has brought too much convenience to the luves of human beings on earth it has also complicated it in a way. There is too many dependancy on electricity and as a result there is overuse of electricity and since most of electricity is generated through natural gas. Too much use of natural gas has a net effect on the earth climate system. This is really bad because it means the next generation of human beings may not find the earth as green as it is today. Also, electricity has led to complexity of many tasks. Today the average human being does not want to do laundry with hands but wants a machine to do that, same goes for warming food with a microwave oven, using a dishwasher to dishes, exercising on a treadmil. Walking around the city on foor is no longer easy one has to obey robot signs and etc. These thigs were made to make life easy for human beings however, if you do not have them or afford them life can be difficult and very complex for you as a human being because things are longer done the manual way.

                    Lastly, new technologies such as the laptops, Smartphones have negative effects on the environment and on the balance of life though they are meant to make life great. If you can not afford these technologies your life becomes very backward. Technology also give too many options to choose from which can sometimes make life of aperson very difficult. Also most of computer technologies of today have a bad footprint on the environment because they expire after some time creating hazardous electronic waste or e-waste. Also, the net energy required to create these technologies and also to transport them across the world also increases and contributes to total pollution of the earth. Technology has impacted every aspect of our lives today, and education is no exception. Technology has changed education in so many ways. First, technology has expanded the access to education and there are huge amounts of information through the Internet and that will enable you to empower yourself  with knowledge.

                    With none of us being aware of the unseen forces deftly striking us, our craze over smart gadgets seems to be never-ending. Soon after their arrival in the market, we are blindfolded by the aptness of these devices, ignoring their power packed negative impact on human health, mostly in the form of non-ionizing radiation. Appreciation for this much necessary scientific evolution increases as it vows to make our life easier. A simple touch or a stylish swipe is all one needs to connect anyone at anytime or to watch what they want. 'One-of-a-kind' by nature-the radiation, disguised as smart-techs, secretly harms the vital organs in our body with a passage of time. The common perception says Cancer is the only ailment that devours as a result of long-term exposure to ionizing or non-ionizing radiation emitting from our daily gadgets. But there are other threats like fatigue, headaches, sleep disruptions, altered memory function, poor concentration and spital awareness which we generally ignore as an issue of any other day.
